Additional command line option (Parenthesis is optional) : 
-co
This changes the rendered object(s) into cone shape. By default (without -co command), they will be sphere shape.
-no n
This creates and renders n object(s) into their own fixed position in fixed integer-square table. By default (without -no command), this will render only 1 object. 
-ts (n)
This renders the object(s) with toon shading by n shade(s). By default, the number of shade is 3 and minimum is 2.
-bmp w h
This causes no OpenGL window and renders all shaded object(s) into an image file with w-pixel width and h-pixel height in BMP format. Minimum width and height are 400 pixels.
-ppm w h
Same as -bmp command but in PPM format. If you adds both -bmp and -ppm commands, it will write only BMP image file.
